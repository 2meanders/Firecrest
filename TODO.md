# TODO

## Text

- Text: Make text selection with mouse work
- TextInput: Make hotkeys work (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, Ctrl+X, Ctrl+A, etc.)
- Support Unicode
- Emojis
- Signed distance fields for text (FT_RENDER_MODE_SDF)?

## New features

- Make the Scene3D take an arbitrary Camera
- Make the display tree convertable to a string, so layouts can be loaded from strings.
- Sliders
- Custom shaders
- Transitions/Animations
- Create Shape-objects that contains their own meshes, so ShapeRenderer2D does not have to rewrite its own for every shape drawn

## Modifications

- Flip the y-axis?
- Smoother scrolling (physics?)
- Split camera movement speed by axies
- Make it possible to run compute shaders without creating a window.
- Cache alignments
- Have caches for GL_DEPTH_TEST, GL_CULL_FACE etc. if there is a performance hit from calling them often.
